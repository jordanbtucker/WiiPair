## Credits

Richard L. Lynch provided the original source code at
https://www.richlynch.com/2009/11/18/permanently-pair-wiimotewii-balance-board/,
however a bug in the source code prevented it from actually working. I adapted
his code to work with Visual Studio 2017, fixed the bug, and updated it to work
with Wii Remotes with Wii MontionPlus inside.
